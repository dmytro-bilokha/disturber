# Disturber

Disturber is an implementation of the [matrix](https://matrix.org/) instant messaging protocol in Java. The application
uses JavaFX for UI. Currently, Disturber is in early alpha stage, only the very basic functionality implemented:

* Receiving text messages and room invites.

* Joining to a room by the invite.

* Sending text messages.

Because Disturber lacks even basic features, like adding new account via GUI (now xml file should be edited manually),
it is useless for regular user :-(
